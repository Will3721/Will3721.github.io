Users can set preferences for price, mileage, year, and MPG to view all cars meeting those specifications, complete with pictures and additional details. Bonus features include car rankings based on various criteria such as durability and safety, and a search function for efficient and economical cars.',

    description: 'We analyzed over 1 million youtube channels to predict subscriber count given attributes such as join date, keywords, and views. We used machine learning techniques such as elastic net linear regression, random forests, and gradient boosting to explore the complex relationships that determine subscriber count. Our final gradient boosting model was able to predict subscriber count with an R\u00B2 value of 0.83.',

We tuned hyperparameters such as learning rate, weight decay, and momentum, and trained the model on the CIFAR-10 dataset, achieving 90% accuracy on test data.",
